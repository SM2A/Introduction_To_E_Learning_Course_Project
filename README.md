# Introduction to E-Learning Course Project

This repository contains my Introduction to E-Learning course projects (Spring 2023) at the University of Tehran.

This project is about teaching traffic signs to kids (elementary school students) using cognitive learning theory and making learner, learns the patterns of how different types of signs are represented.

There is an entry exam to examine learner knowledge before using the app.

Then we show signs in different categories and teach them their meanings. At the end of each lesson is a short quiz to make sure the learner pays attention to the study and learns the topic.

After all, the lessons are done, there is a final exam to see how much learners, learned.

To verify how good our learning method was, we took a remember exam after two weeks to see how much the learner remembered after a while so that we could judge whether this method worked or not.
